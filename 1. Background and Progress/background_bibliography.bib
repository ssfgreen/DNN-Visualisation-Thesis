abstract = {Satisfying the basic requirements of accuracy and understandability of a classifier, decision tree classifiers have become very popular. Instead of constructing the decision tree by a sophisticated algorithm, we introduce a fully interactive method based on a multidimen- sional visualization technique and appropriate interaction capabilities. Thus, domain knowl- edge of an expert can be profitably included in the tree construction phase. Furthermore, after the interactive construction of a decision tree, the user has a much deeper understanding of the data than just knowing the decision tree generated by an arbitrary algorithm. The inter- active approach also overcomes the limitation of most decision trees which are fixed to binary splits for numeric attributes and which do not allow to backtrack in the tree construction phase. Our performance evaluation with sev- eral well-known datasets demonstrates that even users with no a priori knowledge of the data construct a decision tree with an accuracy similar to the tree generated by state of the art algorithms. Additionally, visual interactive classification significantly reduces the tree size and improves the understandibility of the resulting decision tree.},

abstract = {Recently, it was shown that deep neural networks can perform very well if the activities of hidden units are regularized during learning, e.g, by randomly dropping out 50\% of their activities. We describe a method called ‘standout’ in which a binary belief network is overlaid on a neural network and is used to regularize of its hidden units by selectively setting activities to zero. This ‘adaptive dropout network’ can be trained jointly with the neural network by approximately computing local expectations of binary dropout variables, computing derivatives using back-propagation, and using stochastic gradient descent. Interestingly, experiments show that the learnt dropout network parameters recapitulate the neural network parameters, suggesting that a good dropout network regularizes activities according to magnitude. When evaluated on the MNIST and NORB datasets, we found that our method achieves lower classiﬁcation error rates than other feature learning methods, including standard dropout, denoising auto-encoders, and restricted Boltzmann machines. For example, our method achieves 0.80\% and 5.8\% errors on the MNIST and NORB test sets, which is better than state-of-the-art results obtained using feature learning methods, including those that use convolutional architectures.},

abstract = {Hyperparameter learning has traditionally been a manual task because of the limited number of trials. Today's computing infrastructures allow bigger evaluation budgets, thus opening the way for algorithmic approaches. Recently, surrogate-based optimization was successfully applied to hyperparameter learning for deep belief networks and to WEKA classifiers. The methods combined brute force computational power with model building about the behavior of the error function in the hyperparameter space, and they could significantly improve on manual hyperparameter tuning. What may make experienced practitioners even better at hyperparameter optimization is their ability to generalize across similar learning problems. In this paper, we propose a generic method to incorporate knowledge from previous experiments when simultaneously tuning a learning algorithm on new problems at hand. To this end, we combine surrogate-based ranking and optimization techniques for surrogate-based collaborative tuning (SCoT). We demonstrate SCoT in two experiments where it outperforms standard tuning techniques and single-problem surrogate-based optimization.},

abstract = {A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.},

abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimiza- tion. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a compar- ison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural net- works and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising con- figuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent “High Throughput”methods achieve surprising success—they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that randomsearch is a natural base- line against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

In knowledge management, the transfer of knowledge is a core process, which can be improved by using our innate abilities to process visual representations. The potential of visualizations are manifold. But business managers miss a holistic framework on the use of visualization methods for information exploration and communication tasks. This paper analyzes how architects use visualizations to amplify cognition and to transfer knowledge. It introduces a mediating framework that brings together isolated research directions and defines the new research focus knowledge visualization. Knowledge visualization examines the use of visualizations for the transfer of knowledge between at least two people.

One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixed-length vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder--Decoder as an additional feature in the existing linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases.},

abstract = { In this paper, a new learning law for one-dimensional topology preserving neural networks is presented in which the output weights of the neural network converge to a set that produces a predefined winning neuron coordinate probability distribution, when the probability density function of the input signal is unknown and not necessarily uniform. The learning algorithm also produces an orientation preserving homeomorphic function from the known neural coordinate domain to the unknown input signal space, which maps a predefined neural coordinate probability density function into the unknown probability density function of the input signal. The convergence properties of the proposed learning algorithm are analyzed using the ODE approach and verified by a simulation study.},

abstract = {The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data presentation needs a scientific foundation. In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms-dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

The resulting social networks have high value to business intelligence, sociological studies, organizational studies, epidemical studies, etc. The ability to explore and extract information of interest from the networks is thus crucial. However, these networks are often large and composed of multi-categorical nodes and edges, making it difficult to visualize and reason with conventional methods. In this paper, we show how to combine statistical methods with visualization to address these challenges, and how to arrange layouts differently to better bring out different aspects of the networks. We applied our methods to several social networks to demonstrate their effectiveness in characterizing the networks and clarifying the structures of interest, leading to new findings. © 2013.},

Profile HMM has been widely used in bioinformatics research such as sequence alignment, gene structure prediction, motif identification, protein structure prediction, and biological database search. However, few comprehensive, visual editing tools for profile HMM are publicly available. RESULTS: We develop a visual editor for profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMEditor). HMMEditor can visualize the profile HMM architecture, transition probabilities, and emission probabilities. Moreover, it provides functions to edit and save HMM and parameters. Furthermore, HMMEditor allows users to align a sequence against the profile HMM and to visualize the corresponding Viterbi path. CONCLUSION: HMMEditor provides a set of unique functions to visualize and edit a profile HMM. It is a useful tool for biological sequence analysis and modeling.

abstract = {A central challenge to many fields of science and engineering involves minimizing non-convex error functions over continuous, high dimensional spaces. Gradient descent or quasi-Newton methods are almost ubiquitously used to perform such minimizations, and it is often thought that a main source of difficulty for these local methods to find the global minimum is the proliferation of local minima with much higher error than the global minimum. Here we argue, based on results from statistical physics, random matrix theory, neural network theory, and empirical evidence, that a deeper and more profound difficulty originates from the proliferation of saddle points, not local minima, especially in high dimensional problems of practical interest. Such saddle points are surrounded by high error plateaus that can dramatically slow down learning, and give the illusory impression of the existence of a local minimum. Motivated by these arguments, we propose a new approach to second-order optimization, the saddle-free Newton method, that can rapidly escape high dimensional saddle points, unlike gradient descent and quasi-Newton methods. We apply this algorithm to deep or recurrent neural network training, and provide numerical evidence for its superior optimization performance.},

abstract = {This book is aimed to provide an overview of general deep learning methodology and its applications to a variety of signal and information processing tasks. The application areas are chosen with the following three criteria: 1) expertise or knowledge of the authors; 2) the application areas that have already been transformed by the successful use of deep learning technology, such as speech recognition and computer vision; and 3) the application areas that have the potential to be impacted significantly by deep learning and that have gained concentrated research efforts, including natural language and text processing, information retrieval, and multimodal information processing empowered by multi-task deep learning. In Chapter 1, we provide the background of deep learning, as intrinsically connected to the use of multiple layers of nonlinear transformations to derive features from the sensory signals such as speech and visual images. In the most recent literature, deep learning is embodied also as representation learning, which involves a hierarchy of features or concepts where higher-level representations of them are defined from lower-level ones and where the same lower-level representations help to define higher-level ones. In Chapter 2, a brief historical account of deep learning is presented. In particular, selected chronological development of speech recognition is used to illustrate the recent impact of deep learning that has become a dominant technology in speech recognition industry within only a few years since the start of a collaboration between academic and industrial researchers in applying deep learning to speech recognition. In Chapter 3, a three-way classification scheme for a large body of work in deep learning is developed. We classify a growing number of deep learning techniques into unsupervised, supervised, and hybrid categories, and present qualitative descriptions and a literature survey for each category. From Chapter 4 to Chapter 6, we discuss in detail three popular deep networks and related learning methods, one in each category. Chapter 4 is devoted to deep autoencoders as a prominent example of the unsupervised deep learning techniques. Chapter 5 gives a major example in the hybrid deep network category, which is the discriminative feed-forward neural network for supervised learning with many layers initialized using layer-by-layer generative, unsupervised pre-training. In Chapter 6, deep stacking networks and several of the variants are discussed in detail, which exemplify the discriminative or supervised deep learning techniques in the three-way categorization scheme. In Chapters 7-11, we select a set of typical and successful applications of deep learning in diverse areas of signal and information processing and of applied artificial intelligence. In Chapter 7, we review the applications of deep learning to speech and audio processing, with emphasis on speech recognition organized according to several prominent themes. In Chapters 8, we present recent results of applying deep learning to language modeling and natural language processing. Chapter 9 is devoted to selected applications of deep learning to information retrieval including Web search. In Chapter 10, we cover selected applications of deep learning to image object recognition in computer vision. Selected applications of deep learning to multi-modal processing and multi-task learning are reviewed in Chapter 11. Finally, an epilogue is given in Chapter 12 to summarize what we presented in earlier chapters and to discuss future challenges and directions.},

Lead concentrations were determined in one grass species, Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers, (Bermuda grass), collected from 30 different locations in Athens city. The proposed model is a multilayer perception (MLP) trained by backpropagation. The predictive quality of the model was judged by two cross-validation methods. The generalization ability of the model is confirmed by a determination coefficient higher than 0.91. The study of the first partial derivatives of the output of the MLP with respect to each input is used to identify of the factors influencing the lead concentration and the mode of action of each factor. Results allow to classify the environmental descriptors by their decreasing influence on lead concentration: distance of adjacent street, traffic volume density of vegetation, wind velocity, height of building and vegetation height.},

A recent report from the McKinsey Global Institute asserts that machine learning (a.k.a. data mining or predictive analytics) will be the driver of the next big wave of innovation. Several fine textbooks are available to interested practitioners and researchers (for example, Mitchell and Witten et al.). However, much of the “folk knowledge” that is needed to successfully develop machine learning applications is not readily available in them. As a result, many machine learning projects take much longer than necessary or wind up producing less-than-ideal results. Yet much of this folk knowledge is fairly easy to communicate.

Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.},

Beyond the model definitions and the quantitative analyses, there is a need for qualitative comparisons of the solutions learned by various deep architectures. The goal of this paper is to find good qualitative interpretations of high level features represented by such models. To this end, we contrast and compare several techniques applied on Stacked Denoising Autoencoders and Deep Belief Networks, trained on several vision datasets. We show that, perhaps counter-intuitively, such interpretation is possible at the unit level, that it is simple to accomplish and that the results are consistent across various techniques.

abstract = {Much recent research has been devoted to learning algorithms for deep architectures such as Deep Belief Networks and stacks of auto-encoder variants, with impressive results obtained in several areas, mostly on vision and language data sets. The best results obtained on supervised learning tasks involve an unsupervised learning component, usually in an unsupervised pre-training phase. Even though these new algorithms have enabled training deep models, many questions remain as to the nature of this difficult learning problem. The main question investigated here is the following: how does unsupervised pre-training work? Answering this questions is important if learning in deep architectures is to be further improved. We propose several explanatory hypotheses and test them through extensive simulations. We empirically show the influence of pre-training with respect to architecture depth, model capacity, and number of training examples. The experiments confirm and clarify the advantage of unsupervised pre-training. The results suggest that unsupervised pre-training guides the learning towards basins of attraction of minima that support better generalization from the training data set; the evidence from these results supports a regularization explanation for the effect of pre-training.},

abstract = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multilayer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We ﬁrst observe the inﬂuence of the non-linear activations functions. We ﬁnd that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We ﬁnd that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneﬁcial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difﬁcult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},

Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with extra-unlabelled data, deep rectifier networks can reach their best performance without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with large labelled data sets. Hence, these results can be seen as a new milestone in the attempts at understanding the difficulty in training deep but purely supervised nueral networks, and closing the performance gap between neural networks learnt with and without unsupervised pre-training},

First, an overview of the neural network methodology is presented. This is followed by some practical guidelines for implementing back-propagation neural networks.

Though most research to date assumes a single-user focus on perceptual and cognitive processes, in practice, sensemaking is often a social process involving parallelization of effort, discussion, and consensus building. This suggests that to fully support sensemaking, interactive visualization should also support social interaction. However, the most appropriate collaboration mechanisms for supporting this interaction are not immediately clear.

In this paper, we investigate the design of history mechanisms for information visualization. We present a design space analysis of both architectural and interface issues, identifying design decisions and associated trade-offs. Based on this analysis, we contribute a design study of graphical history tools for Tableau, a database visualization system. These tools record and visualize interaction histories, support data analysis and communication of findings, and contribute novel mechanisms for presenting, managing, and exporting histories. Furthermore, we have analyzed aggregated collections of history sessions to evaluate Tableau usage.

Despite numerous advances in algorithms and visualization techniques for understanding such social networks, the process of constructing network models and performing exploratory analysis remains difficult and time-consuming. In this paper we present Orion, a system for interactive modeling, transformation and visualization of network data. Orion's interface enables the rapid manipulation of large graphs-including the specification of complex linking relationships-using simple drag-and-drop operations with desired node types. Orion maps these user interactions to statements in a declarative workflow language that incorporates both relational operators (e.g., selection, aggregation and joins) and network analytics (e.g., centrality measures). We demonstrate how these features enable analysts to flexibly construct and compare networks in domains such as online health communities, academic collaboration and distributed software development.},

Common recurrent neural networks, however, do not explicitly accommodate such a hierarchy, and most research on them has been focusing on training algorithms rather than on their basic architecture. In this pa- per we study the effect of a hierarchy of recurrent neural networks on processing time series. Here, each layer is a recurrent network which receives the hidden state of the previous layer as input. This architecture allows us to perform hi- erarchical processing on difficult temporal tasks, and more naturally capture the structure of time series. We show that they reach state-of-the-art performance for recurrent networks in character-level language modeling when trained with sim- ple stochastic gradient descent. We also offer an analysis of the different emergent time scales.},

abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different “thinned” networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets},

There have been numerous demonstrations of sensible generalization which have depended on the experimenter choosing appropriately similar patterns for diferent concepts.

This "overfitting" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random "dropout" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition.},

abstract = {In many recent object recognition systems, feature extraction stages are generally composed of a filter bank, a non-linear transformation, and some sort of feature pooling layer. Most systems use only one stage of feature extraction in which the filters are hard-wired, or two stages where the filters in one or both stages are learned in supervised or unsupervised mode. This paper addresses three questions: 1. How does the non-linearities that follow the filter banks influence the recognition accuracy? 2. does learning the filter banks in an unsupervised or supervised manner improve the performance over random filters or hardwired filters? 3. Is there any advantage to using an architecture with two stages of feature extraction, rather than one? We show that using non-linearities that include rectification and local contrast normalization is the single most important ingredient for good accuracy on object recognition benchmarks. We show that two stages of feature extraction yield better accuracy than one. Most surprisingly, we show that a two-stage system with random filters can yield almost 63\% recognition rate on Caltech-101, provided that the proper non-linearities and pooling layers are used. Finally, we show that with supervised refinement, the system achieves state-of-the-art performance on NORB dataset (5.6\%) and unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised refinement produces good accuracy on Caltech-101 (\&amp;gt; 65\%), and the lowest known error rate on the undistorted, unprocessed MNIST dataset (0.53\%).},

abstract = {Wise management of electricity consumption is becoming increasingly important. Domestic electricity prices in the UK increased by 35 \% over the past 8 years; an upward trend which is unlikely to reverse any time soon. As well as the economic costs, the environmental problems associated with the combustion of fossil fuels are becoming increasingly detrimental to the well-being of many species, including our own. One of the cheapest and easiest ways to improve energy efficiency is to monitor one's electricity consumption using a type of smart meter called a “home energy monitor” available for around £40. These display whole-house consumption in real-time, allowing the user to learn which devices and behaviours consume the most energy. Studies have demonstrated that the feedback provided by energy monitors can enable users to reduce consumption by 5-15 \%. If every domestic user in the UK reduced electricity consumption by 10 \% then the UK's annual CO2 output would be reduced by 6 million tonnes. However, the information displayed by home energy monitors is not as useful as it could be. Home energy monitors measure aggregate consumption for an entire building. Research has demonstrated that disaggregated information describing appliance-by-appliance energy consumption is more effective than aggregate information. Disaggregation was first successfully implemented in the 1980s using sophisticated smart meters which provide rich, multi-dimensional raw sensor data. However, these sophisticated meters are not readily available at present. The main contribution of this project is to design, implement and evaluate three different algorithms for disaggregating the sparse, one-dimensional data output by inexpensive, popular and readily available home energy monitors. Each design is trained to recognise a device on the basis of one or more raw recordings of single-device power consumption (which we call signatures). The system is then given an unseen aggregate signal from which it must infer the start times, run duration and energy consumption of each device activation present in the aggregate data. The first design is a simple prototype which uses a least mean squares approach to matching a signature to an aggregate signal. As expected, this design succeeds only in a very limited set of contexts but the development of this prototype provided valuable insights. The second design represents a novel approach to determining a set of device power states by identifying peaks in the histogram of the device's signature but this design proved to not be ideal. The final design presented in this dissertation represents a novel approach to disaggregation whereby each device is modelled as a power state graph. Each graph vertex (node) represents a power state and each edge represents the conditions necessary to transition from the source to the destination power state. During disaggregation, every possible “fit” of the power state graph to the aggregate data is represented as a tree structure where each tree vertex represents a power state and each tree edge represents the likelihood for the corresponding power state transition. For each complete “fit” of the power state graph to the aggregate data, the disaggregation algorithm reports the start time, the average likelihood, the estimated run time and the estimated total energy consumption. This design has several attractive features: 1) it handles both simple devices and complex devices whose signatures contain power state sequences which repeat an arbitrary number of times; 2) it is probabilistic; 3) a power state graph can be learnt from one or more signatures and 4) the design estimates the energy consumed by each device activation. This design was evaluated by training it to recognise four real devices: a toaster, a kettle, a washing machine and a tumble drier. The system was then given 13 days of real aggregate data. For all devices except the tumble drier it detected every device activation in the aggregate data although there were a few false positives. The system failed to model the tumble drier, possibly because the drier has very rapid state transitions.},

abstract = {Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization often appears to get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently proposed a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning procedure relying on the training algorithm of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to initialize the parameters of a deep belief network (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. This was followed by the proposal of another greedy layer-wise procedure, relying on the usage of autoassociator networks. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study these algorithms empirically to better understand their success. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy helps the optimization by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, but also implicitly acts as a sort of regularization that brings better generalization and encourages internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input. We also present a series of experiments aimed at evaluating the link between the performance of deep neural networks and practical aspects of their topology, for example, demonstrating cases where the addition of more depth helps. Finally, we empirically explore simple variants of these training algorithms, such as the use of different RBM input unit distributions, a simple way of combining gradient estimators to improve performance, as well as on-line versions of those algorithms. },

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to many tasks such as digit and object recognition. Using convolutional (tied) weights significantly reduces the number of parameters that have to be learned, and also allows translational invariance to be hard-coded into the architecture. In this pa- per, we consider the problem of learning invariances, rather than relying on hard- coding. We propose tiled convolution neural networks (Tiled CNNs), which use a regular “tiled” pattern of tied weights that does not require that adjacent hidden units share identical weights, but instead requires only that hidden units k steps away from each other to have tied weights. By pooling over neighboring units, this architecture is able to learn complex invariances (such as scale and rotational invariance) beyond translational invariance. Further, it also enjoysmuch ofCNNs’ advantage of having a relatively small number of learned parameters (such as ease of learning and greater scalability). We provide an efficient learning algorithm for Tiled CNNs based on Topographic ICA, and show that learning complex invariant features allows us to achieve highly competitive results for both the NORB and CIFAR-10 datasets.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of building high- level, class-specific feature detectors from only unlabeled data. For example, is it possible to learn a face detector using only unlabeled images? To answer this, we train a 9-layered locally connected sparse autoencoder with pooling and local contrast normalization on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 bil- lion connections, the dataset has 10 million 200x200 pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous SGD on a clus- ter with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental re- sults reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bod- ies. Starting with these learned features, we trained our network to obtain 15.8\% accu- racy in recognizing 20,000 object categories from ImageNet, a leap of 70\% relative im- provement over the previous state-of-the-art.},

algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient based
learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture,
gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex
decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as
handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews
various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and
compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task.
Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal
with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other
techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of
multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition,
and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer
networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally
using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance
measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described.
Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the
flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network
for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional
neural network character recognizers combined with global training
techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques.
It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day

abstract = {Data visualization techniques are very important for data analysis, since the human eye has been frequently advocated as the ultimate data-mining tool. However, there has been surprisingly little work on visualizing massive time series datasets. To this end, we developed VizTree, a time series pattern discovery and visualization system based on augmenting suffix trees. VizTree visually summarizes both the global and local structures of time series data at the same time. In addition, it provides novel interactive solutions to many pattern discovery problems, including the discovery of frequently occurring patterns (motif discovery), surprising patterns (anomaly detection), and query by content. VizTree works by transforming the time series into a symbolic representation, and encoding the data in a modified suffix tree in which the frequency and other properties of patterns are mapped onto colors and other visual properties. We demonstrate the utility of our system by comparing it with state-of- the-art batch algorithms on several real and synthetic datasets. Based on the tree structure, we further device a coefficient which measures the dissimilarity between any two time series. This coefficient is shown to be competitive with the well-known Euclidean distance.},

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence theway in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza- tions produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account 1 , deeply rooted in psychological 2 and neuroscientific 3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory pro-cessing systems 4,5 , the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopa-minergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms 3 . While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains 6–8 , their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks 9–11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning.

Given that DNNs are now able to classify objects in images with near-human-level performance, questions naturally arise as to what differences remain between com- puter and human vision. A recent study [30] revealed that changing an image (e.g. of a lion) in a way imperceptible to humans can cause a DNN to label the image as something else entirely (e.g. mislabeling a lion a library). Here we show a related result: it is easy to produce images that are completely unrecognizable to humans, but that state-of-the- art DNNs believe to be recognizable objects with 99.99\% confidence (e.g. labeling with certainty that white noise static is a lion). Specifically, we take convolutional neu- ral networks trained to perform well on either the ImageNet or MNIST datasets and then find images with evolutionary algorithms or gradient ascent that DNNs label with high confidence as belonging to each dataset class. It is possi- ble to produce images totally unrecognizable to human eyes that DNNs believe with near certainty are familiar objects, which we call “fooling images” (more generally, fooling ex- amples). Our results shed light on interesting differences between human vision and current DNNs, and raise ques- tions about the generality of DNN computer vision},

abstract = {Several recent publications have proposed methods for mapping images into con- tinuous semantic embedding spaces. In some cases the embedding space is trained jointly with the image transformation. In other cases the semantic embedding space is established by an independent natural language processing task, and then the image transformation into that space is learned in a second stage. Proponents of these image embedding systems have stressed their advantages over the traditional n-way classification framing of image understanding, particularly in terms of the promise for zero-shot learning – the ability to correctly annotate images of previously unseen object categories. In this paper, we propose a simple method for constructing an image embedding system from any existing n-way image classifier and a semantic word embedding model, which contains the n class labels in its vocabulary. Our method maps images into the semantic embedding space via convex combination of the class label embedding vectors, and requires no addi- tional training. We show that this simple and direct method confers many of the advantages associated with more complex image embedding schemes, and indeed outperforms state of the art methods on the ImageNet zero-shot learning task.},

abstract = {The ever-increasing amount of information flowing through Social Media forces the members of these networks to compete for attention and influence by relying on other people to spread their message. A large study of information propagation within Twitter reveals that the majority of users act as passive information consumers and do not forward the content to the network. Therefore, in order for individuals to become influential they must not only obtain attention and thus be popular, but also overcome user passivity. We propose an algorithm that determines the influence and passivity of users based on their information forwarding activity. An evaluation performed with a 2.5 million user dataset shows that our influence measure is a good predictor of URL clicks, outperforming several other measures that do not explicitly take user passivity into account. We also explicitly demonstrate that high popularity does not necessarily imply high influence and vice-versa.},

The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data.

Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

An experiment was conducted, where N = 32 pupils from a German high school studied either only text-based worked examples explaining different problem categories from the domain of algebra or worked examples augmented with hybrid animations.

To reduce clutter and improve the readability of node-link views, Holten \&amp; van Wijk's force-directed edge bundling employs a physical simulation to spatially group graph edges. While both useful and aesthetic, this technique has shortcomings: it bundles spatially proximal edges regardless of direction, weight, or graph connectivity. As a result, high-level directional edge patterns are obscured. We present divided edge bundling to tackle these shortcomings. By modifying the forces in the physical simulation, directional lanes appear as an emergent property of edge direction. By considering graph topology, we only bundle edges related by graph structure. Finally, we aggregate edge weights in bundles to enable more accurate visualization of total bundle weights. We compare visualizations created using our technique to standard force-directed edge bundling, matrix diagrams, and clustered graphs; we find that divided edge bundling leads to visualizations that are easier to interpret and reveal both familiar and previously obscured patterns.},

abstract = {Neural networks are a powerful technology for classification of visual inputs arising from documents. However, there is a confusing plethora of different neural network methods that are used in the literature and in industry. This paper describes a set of concrete best practices that document analysis researchers can use to get good results with neural networks. The most important practice is getting a training set as large as possible: we expand the training set by adding a new form of distorted data. The next most important practice is that convolutional neural networks are better suited for visual document tasks than fully connected networks. We propose that a simple "do-it-yourself" implementation of convolution with a flexible architecture is suitable for many visual document problems. This simple convolutional neural network does not require complex methods, such as momentum, weight decay, structure-dependent learning rates, averaging layers, tangent prop, or even finely-tuning the architecture. The end result is a very simple yet general architecture which can yield state-of-the-art performance for document analysis. We illustrate our claims on the MNIST set of English digit images.},

The second technique computes a class saliency map, specific to a given image and class. We show that such maps can be employed for weakly supervised object segmentation using classification ConvNets.

abstract = {Artificial neural networks have been used for simulation, modeling, and control purposes in many engineering applications as an alternative to conventional expert systems. Although neural networks usually do not reach the level of performance exhibited by expert systems, they do enjoy a tremendous advantage of very low construction costs. This paper addresses the issue of identifying important input parameters in building a multilayer, backpropagation network for a typical class of engineering problems. These problems are characterized by having a large number of input variables of varying degrees of importance; and identifying the important variables is a common issue since elimination of the unimportant inputs leads to a simplification of the problem and often a more accurate modeling or solution. We compare three different methods for ranking input importance: sensitivity analysis, fuzzy curves, and change of MSE (mean square error); and analyze their effectiveness. Simulation results based on experiments with simple mathematical functions as well as a real engineering problem are reported. Based on the analysis and our experience in building neural networks, we also propose a general methodology for building backpropagation networks for typical engineering applications.},

Recently developed algorithms have been successful at training RNNs to perform a wide variety of tasks, but the resulting networks have been treated as black boxes: their mechanism of operation remains unknown. Here we explore the hypothesis that fixed points, both stable and unstable, and the linearized dynamics around them, can reveal crucial aspects of how RNNs implement their computations. Further, we explore the utility of linearization in areas of phase space that are not true fixed points but merely points of very slow movement. We present a simple optimization technique that is applied to trained RNNs to find the fixed and slow points of their dynamics. Linearization around these slow regions can be used to explore, or reverse-engineer, the behavior of the RNN. We describe the technique, illustrate it using simple examples, and finally showcase it on three high-dimensional RNN examples: a 3-bit flip-flop device, an input-dependent sine wave generator, and a two-point moving average. In all cases, the mechanisms of trained networks could be inferred from the sets of fixed and slow points and the linearized dynamics around them.},

abstract = {Deep and recurrent neural networks (DNNs and RNNs respectively) are powerful models that were considered to be almost impossible to train using stochastic gradient descent with momentum. In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient descent with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular type of slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both DNNs and RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance that were previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization. We find that both the initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized networks cannot be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform markedly worse when the momentum is absent or poorly tuned. Our success training these models suggests that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random initializations have likely failed due to poor initialization schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned momentum methods suffice for dealing with the curvature issues in deep and recurrent network training objectives without the need for sophisticated second-order methods.},

EnsembleMatrix allows users to directly interact with the visualizations in order to explore and build combination models. We evaluate the efficacy of the system and the approach in a user study. Results show that users are able to quickly combine multiple classifiers operating on multiple feature sets to produce an ensemble classifier with accuracy that approaches best-reported performance classifying images in the CalTech-101 dataset.},

As a powerful learning tool, increasingly neural networks have been adopted by many large-scale information processing applications but there is no a set of well de ned criteria for choosing a neural network. The user mostly treats a neural network as a black box and cannot explain how learning from input data was done nor how performance can be consistently ensured. We have experimented with several information visualization designs aiming to open the black box to possibly uncover underlying dependencies between the input data and the output data of a neural network. In this paper, we present our designs and show that the visualizations not only help us design more ef cient neural networks, but also assist us in the process of using neural networks for problem solving such as performing a classi cation task.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of frustrating, unhelpful software interfaces has motivated decades of research into Human-Computer Interaction. In this paper, I suggest that the long-standing focus on interaction may be misguided. For a majority subset of software, called information software, I argue that interactivity is actually a curse for users and a crutch for designers, and users' goals can be better satisfied through other means. Information software design can be seen as the design of context-sensitive information graphics. I demonstrate the crucial role of information graphic design, and present three approaches to context-sensitivity, of which interactivity is the last resort. After discussing the cultural changes necessary for these design ideas to take root, I address their implementation. I outline a tool which may allow designers to create data-dependent graphics with no engineering assistance, and also outline a platform which may allow an unprecedented level of implicit context-sharing between independent programs. I conclude by asserting that the principles of information software design will become critical as technology improves. Although this paper presents a number of concrete design and engineering ideas, the larger intent is to introduce a unified theory of information software design, and provide inspiration and direction for progressive designers who suspect that the world of software isn' t as flat as they' ve been told.},

One visualization shows a traditional network graph with email contacts as nodes. The second visualization depicts the temporal rhythms of interactions in dyadic relationships between ego and individual contacts. While observing and interviewing users of these systems, it became clear that, when used in tandem, these visualizations complemented and clarified each others depiction of a persons social network. Based on our experience with these two systems, we propose that visualizations of social networks that are aimed at end users ought to go beyond the graph paradigm. We posit that basic cartographic principles such as adaptive zooming and multiple viewing modes provide system designers with useful visual solutions to the depiction of social networks.},

We found that these visualizations allow us to analyze object detection systems in new ways and gain new insight into the detector’s fail- ures. For example, when we visualize the features for high scoring false alarms, we discovered that, although they are clearly wrong in image space, they do look deceptively sim- ilar to true positives in feature space. This result suggests that many of these false alarms are caused by our choice of feature space, and indicates that creating a better learning algorithm or building bigger datasets is unlikely to correct these errors.

On the other hand, it could be a challenge for endoscopists as they need another specialized discipline, which is histology, and should be able to integrate this new domain knowledge into their clinical practice to make better medical judgement. This challenge is the motivation for us to initialize a computer-aided decision making system that has the ability to quantitatively analyze confocal images and return informative output which can assist endoscopists to improve their medical diagnosis. Primary objective of this project is to create a computer-aided decision support system that has the ability to assist endoscopists in establishing the final diagnosis on the information of confocal laser endomicroscopic images of the colon. We are particularly interested in confocal images of the colon because colon-related diseases are relatively common regardless ethnic. We develop a system based on ”content-based image retrieval” or CBIR method which has the ability to perform image search and finally present endoscopists a number of similar images from which they are able to decide themselves on the final diagnosis. The search according to CBIR analyzes image similarity based on image signatures derived from texture analysis using Gabor filters bank and texture distance between images is computed under Earth Mover’s distance with scale- and rotation-invariant features. We employ a ”patch technique” which is to select only certain parts of example images and search according to them instead of the conventional method which usually processes the entire example image. Moreover, we incorporate ”relevance feedback” which has potential to adapt the search behavior towards the user’s need. The mechanism of relevance feedback fundamentally operates on embedded manifold obtained from ”Isomap”. We conducted experiments on a database of 1000 confocal images which are all classified by clinical experts based on Miami classification. The final results showed that the patch technique outperformed the conventional method. Our system achieved the retrieval rate of 87.78\% when the ability to distinguish between neoplastic and benign categories is the criteria of accuracy. Interestingly, it achieved the retrieval rate of 58.89\% when the ability to return images with correct classification is the criteria to determine the accuracy of the system. In addition, there is also an ongoing preliminary experiment to study the feasibility to integrate an Eye Tracking system into our computer-aided decision support system and the result will be reported in the near future.},

abstract = {Neurons send signals to each other by means of sequences of action potentials (spikes). Ignoring variations in spike amplitude and shape that are probably not meaningful to a receiving cell, the information content, or entropy of the signal depends on only the timing of action potentials, and because there is no external clock, only the interspike intervals, and not the absolute spike times, are significant. Estimating spike train entropy is a difficult task, particularly with small data sets, and many methods of entropy estimation have been proposed. Here we present two related model-based methods for estimating the entropy of neural signals and compare them to existing methods. One of the methods is fast and reasonably accurate, and it converges well with short spike time records; the other is impractically time-consuming but apparently very accurate, relying on generating artificial data that are a statistical match to the experimental data. Using the slow, accurate method to generate a best-estimate entropy value, we find that the faster estimator converges to this value more closely and with smaller data sets than many existing entropy estimators.},

abstract = {Algorithms for evolutionary computation, which simulate the process of natural selection to solve optimization problems, are an effective tool for discovering high-performing reinforcement-learning policies. Because they can automatically find good representations, handle continuous action spaces, and cope with partial observability, evolutionary reinforcement-learning approaches have a strong empirical track record, sometimes significantly outperforming temporal-difference methods. This chapter surveys research on the application of evolutionary computation to reinforcement learning, overviewing methods for evolving neural-network topologies and weights, hybrid methods that also use temporal-difference methods, coevolutionary methods for multi-agent settings, generative and developmental systems, and methods for on-line evolutionary reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic. Such a grammar allows us to move beyond named graphics (e.g., the "scatterplot") and gain insight into the deep structure that underlies statistical graphics. This article builds on Wilkinson, Anand, and Grossman (2005), describing extensions and refinements developed while building an open source implementation of the grammar of graphics for R, ggplot 2. The topics in this article include an introduction to the grammar by working through the process of creating a plot, and discussing the components that we need. The grammar is then presented formally and compared to Wilkinson's grammar, highlighting the hierarchy of defaults, and the implications of embedding a graphical grammar into a programming language. The power of the grammar is illustrated with a selection of examples that explore different components and their interactions, in more detail. The article concludes by discussing some perceptual issues, and thinking about how we can build on the grammar M learn how to create graphical "poems." Supplemental materials are available online.},

abstract = {This thesis describes three families of tools for exploring data and models. It is organised in roughly the same way that you perform a data analysis. First, you get the data in a form that you can work with; Section 1.1 introduces the reshape framework for restructuring data, described fully in Chapter 2. Second, you plot the data to get a feel for what is going on; Section 1.2 introduces the layered grammar of graphics, described in Chapter 3. Third, you iterate between graphics and models to build a succinct quantitative summary of the data; Section 1.3 introduces strategies for visualising models, discussed in Chapter 4. Finally, you look back at what you have done, and contemplate what tools you need to do better in the future; Chapter 5 summarises the impact of my work and my plans for the future. The tools developed in this thesis are firmly based in the philosophy of exploratory data analysis (Tukey, 1977). With every view of the data, we strive to be both curious and sceptical. We keep an open mind towards alternative explanations, never believing we have found the best model. Due to space limitations, the following papers only give a glimpse at this philosophy of data analysis, but it underlies all of the tools and strategies that are developed. A fuller data analysis, using many of the tools developed in this thesis, is available in Hobbs et al. (To appear).},

abstract = {Large Convolutional Network models have recently demonstrated impressive classification performance on the ImageNet benchmark. However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this paper we address both issues. We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. This enables us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky $\backslash$etal on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.},

abstract = {We present a hierarchical model that learns image decompositions via alternating layers of convolutional sparse coding and max pooling. When trained on natural images, the layers of our model capture image information in a variety of forms: low-level edges, mid-level edge junctions, high-level object parts and complete objects. To build our model we rely on a novel inference scheme that ensures each layer reconstructs the input, rather than just the output of the layer directly beneath, as is common with existing hierarchical approaches. This makes it possible to learn multiple layers of representation and we show models with 4 layers, trained on images from the Caltech-101 and 256 datasets. When combined with a standard classifier, features extracted from these models outperform SIFT, as well as representations from other feature learning methods.},
