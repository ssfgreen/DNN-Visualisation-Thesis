## Overview

This thesis contained in this repository explores visualisation as a method to shed light upon how deep neural networks during training in order to assist researchers more effectively train and debug their models.

The thesis is divided into two parts.

- A survey of existing literature into neural networks and visualisation techniques.
- An exploration of a novel approach to visualising deep neural networks using a combination of _t-SNE_ and _PCA_ to reduce the dimensionality of the data and _D3.js_ to visualise and make interactive the results.
